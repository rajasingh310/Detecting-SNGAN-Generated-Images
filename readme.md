## Description

This project is focused on classifying real and fake images using various image processing techniques. It includes code for training and evaluating convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on different types of image data, such as RGB, grayscale, and FFT-transformed images.

## Project Details

- **Author:** Rajababu Singh
- **Matriculation number:** 1530580
- **Supervisor:** Dr. Margret Keuper
- **Affiliation:** University of Siegen

## Project Structure

The project script is organized into several sections:

1. **Data Preparation**: The script prepares the image datasets for training and validation. Real and fake images are stored in specific directories.

2. **Training CNN Models**: The script trains CNN models using various image data types, such as RGB, grayscale, and FFT-transformed images. Each type of data is processed separately.

3. **Transfer Learning**: Transfer learning is supported for specific CNN models. The script allows for fine-tuning pre-trained models on your image data.

4. **Function Explanations**: The script includes explanations for the functions used for data preprocessing, network training, and hyperparameter tuning.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- MATLAB with Deep Learning Toolbox


## Directories

The given zip file contains the following folders

1. 'Python code Raml': This folder contains code for Detecting Generated Images with machine learning approaches such as
SVM and logistic regression by extracting simple features from 2D DFT. To run this code open this folder in Python ide, add the train and test dataset to this folder, and run the main.py file. Please refer to the code for more details.
